# Take-out project 

## Introduction

In this data analysis, we use anonymized data coming from online food delivery platform (ele.me and Meituan) which are the 2 biggest food delivery service in China. We conbined data from those platforms to analyze the revenue performance of the restaurant registered on the APP (sales revenue, GMV, orders...) and the Ads campaign RoI invested by the restaurants.

The data source is coming from 3 CSV files. We joined the data using ID matching and created one Dashboard of the sales revenue performance on Tableau and one Weekly report on Excel. 

## Dashboard

The dashboard monitors daily sales activity on the platform. The data can be filtered according to date filter and platform filter (which are shown on right-up corner). The dashboard includes sales overview, sales details, order distribution map, ratio of new and regular customers...


## Weekly report

Taking the second week of August 2020 as an example, we analyze weekly cumulative metrics, week-to-week metrics, key revenue metrics and marketing performance metrics.

By platform filter, you can view the data of each platform. 
You can as well change the date in the key revenue metrics table and marketing performance metrics table. Doing so will update the related result automatically. 

Finally, we can as well modify the column name in the tables, if the new name match with one of the source data column, it will update the table automatically.
